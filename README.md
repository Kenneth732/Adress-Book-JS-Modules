It's great that you're looking to focus on key topics that can provide you with a solid foundation of knowledge. The idea that 20% of information can provide 80% of the results is often associated with the Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule. This principle suggests that a small portion of effort or input can yield a majority of the desired outcomes.

To help you choose three topics that cover a broad spectrum of knowledge, consider selecting areas that are interconnected and applicable to various aspects of life. Here are three suggestions:

1. **Critical Thinking and Problem Solving:** Developing strong critical thinking skills can significantly enhance your ability to analyze situations, make informed decisions, and solve problems effectively. This skill is applicable across various domains, such as personal life, work, and education. It involves evaluating information, considering multiple perspectives, and making sound judgments.

2. **Communication Skills:** Effective communication is crucial in all aspects of life. Whether it's written, verbal, or nonverbal communication, being able to express your thoughts clearly and understand others' messages can lead to success in personal relationships, professional collaborations, and public interactions.

3. **Basic Science and Technology Understanding:** A foundation in basic science (physics, chemistry, biology) and technology (computers, digital systems) can empower you to comprehend and engage with the world in a more meaningful way. This knowledge can help you understand fundamental principles governing natural phenomena and the technologies that shape modern life.

By focusing on these three topics, you'll be building skills and knowledge that can serve as a strong foundation for personal and professional growth. Remember that while these topics cover a lot, they also connect to many other areas of knowledge. The key is to cultivate the ability to apply what you learn to a wide range of situations.
